# Calculator App in Java

A sleek GUI calculator implementation in Java, styled after the iPhone calculator. This project demonstrates core Java Swing concepts for building interactive graphical interfaces.

## Features

- **iPhone-like UI**: Clean, minimalist design with color-coded operation buttons
- **Basic Operations**: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- **Functions**: Percentage calculations and sign switching
- **Memory Functions**: Continuous calculations using previous result

## Technologies Used

- **Java Swing**: For GUI components and event handling
- **AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit)**: For layout management and basic graphics
- **Pure Java**: No external dependencies - uses only standard Java libraries

## How to Use

1. Run the `Calculator` class to launch the application
2. Use mouse clicks to:
    - Enter numbers (0-9)
    - Select operations (+, -, ร, รท)
    - Calculate results (=)
    - Clear input (C)
    - Use special functions (+/-, %)

## Implementation Details

The calculator demonstrates:
- Swing component creation (JFrame, JButton, JTextField)
- Grid-based layout management
- Event-driven programming with ActionListener
- State management for calculator operations
- String parsing and number formatting
